Still have some work to do to finish this up, though I'm happy it's working.
Alpha Beta pruning is providing a different result from the basic MiniMax algorithm which shouldn't be happening
Only white can castle
Neither side can promote pawns or en passant
Even if these were in, black would have to have special programming so the ai recognises things like the rook moving while castling, or
	transforming a pawn that got promoted.

Happy with how the ai is playing despite the lacking moves
